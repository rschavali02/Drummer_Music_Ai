##Why?

This was build due to my own frustrations from searching for drumless backing tracks to play on top of. As an experienced drummer, I wanted a specific combination of feel and tempo. To solve this problem I used Meta's music gen model to build a drumless beat generator to drum to. This has made my practice much more fun and simplified the problem for me.
